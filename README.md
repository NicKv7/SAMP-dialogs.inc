# SAMP-dialogs.inc
One of its kind include which actually adds new dialog styles to ShowPlayerDialog (the existing default samp native). The new dialogs are built on textdraws but have almost similar style to those of SAMP GUI. All the responses are held in a similar way how other dialogs styles does, under callback OnDialogResponse.
Cross compatibility which means you can use this include in filterscripts, includes and gamemode all time.
